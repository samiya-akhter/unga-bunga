### Problem Statement

Petya studies in a school and he adores Maths. His class has been studying arithmetic expressions. On the last class the teacher wrote three positive integers *a*, *b*, *c* on the blackboard. The task was to insert signs of operations '`+`' and '`*`', and probably brackets between the numbers so that the value of the resulting expression is as large as possible. Let's consider an example: assume that the teacher wrote numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the blackboard. Here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

 
-  1+2*3=7 

-  1*(2+3)=5 

-  1*2*3=6 

-  (1+2)*3=9 
Note that you can insert operation signs only between *a* and *b*, and between *b* and *c*, that is, you cannot swap integers. For instance, in the given sample you cannot get expression (1+3)*2.

It's easy to see that the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.

Your task is: given *a*, *b* and *c* print the maximum value that you can get.

### Input

The input contains three integers *a*, *b* and *c*, each on a single line (1 ≤ *a*, *b*, *c* ≤ 10).

### Output

Print the maximum value of the expression that you can obtain.

### Example

**Example 1**

```input
1
2
3
```

```output
9
```

**Example 2**

```input
2
10
3
```

```output
60
```
