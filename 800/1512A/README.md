### Problem Statement

You are given an array a consisting of n (n \ge 3) positive integers. It is known that in this array, all the numbers except one are the same (for example, in the array [4, 11, 4, 4] all numbers except one are equal to 4).

Print the index of the element that does not equal others. The numbers in the array are numbered from one.

### Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100). Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 100) — the length of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 100).

It is guaranteed that all the numbers except one in the a array are the same.

### Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the index of the element that is not equal to others.

### Example

**Example**

```input
4
4
11 13 11 11
5
1 4 4 4 4
10
3 3 3 3 10 3 3 3 3 3
3
20 20 10
```

```output
2
1
5
3
```
