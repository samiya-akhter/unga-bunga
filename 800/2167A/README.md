### Problem Statement

You are given 4 sticks of lengths a, b, c, and d. You can not break or bend them.

Determine whether it is possible to form a square^{\text{∗}} using the given sticks.

^{\text{∗}}A *square* is defined as a polygon consisting of 4 vertices, of which all sides have equal length and all inner angles are equal. No two edges of the polygon may intersect each other.

### Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains four integers a, b, c, and d (1 \le a, b, c, d \le 10) — the lengths of the sticks.

### Output

For each test case, print "`YES`" if it is possible to form a square using the given sticks, and "`NO`" otherwise.

You may print each letter in any case (uppercase or lowercase). For example, the strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", "`Yes`", and "`YES`" will all be recognized as a positive answer.

### Example

**Example**

```input
7
1 2 3 4
1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2
1 2 1 2
1 1 5 5
5 5 5 5
4 10 5 9
```

```output
NO
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES
NO
```

### Note

In the first test case, we can prove that we can't make a square.

In the second, third, and sixth test cases, we can make a square like this:
